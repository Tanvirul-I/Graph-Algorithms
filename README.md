# Graph-Algorithms
Graph algorithm implementations in python. The graph contains an adjacency list and vertices implementations that use Python dataclasses.

The Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms are implemented using Python's heapq. The Prim's algorithm implementation returns a new Graph, but it only includes the edges and weights in the MST. The Dijkstra's algorithm implementation returns the path between the two given vertices.
